//! Han, Ooka and Kikumoto's wall-function bounce, on-node, as their eq. 14 states it
//! (`wall_model: "spalding_bounce"`): M. Han, R. Ooka, H. Kikumoto, *A wall function approach in
//! lattice Boltzmann method: algorithm and validation using turbulent channel flow*, Fluid Dyn.
//! Res. 53:045506, 2021 (doi:10.1088/1873-7005/ac1782), §2.1–2.3 and Appendix A.
//!
//! **The scheme.** A boundary node lies on the wall (their node `(i, 0, k)`). Its collision is
//! replaced by eq. 14; the streaming is unchanged. With the inward normal `n` (their `+y`):
//! - every axis population and every population parallel to the wall bounces back,
//!   `f*_q = f_q̄` (their eq. 14c: `f1* = f2`, `f2* = f1`, …, `f9* = f10`, `f15* = f16`, …);
//! - each diagonal pointing into the fluid takes the specular image of the population arriving
//!   from the fluid plus the wall stress (their eqs. 14a–b): with `t = c_q − n` its tangential
//!   part along axis b, `f*_q = f_{q'} + (Δt / 2Δy) τ_{w,b} t_b`, `c_{q'} = t − n`;
//! - each diagonal pointing into the wall takes the value of its opposite (their `f8* = f̃7*`,
//!   `f12* = f̃11*`, `f13* = f̃14*`, `f18* = f̃17*`); it streams out of the box and is dropped;
//! - the rest population is kept.
//!
//! `τ_{w,b} = −(u_b / |u_t|) τ_w` (their eq. 15) opposes the velocity parallel to the wall of the
//! interior node one cell above, `(i, 1, k)`, at distance `Δy`, and `τ_w = ρ u_τ²` with `u_τ`
//! from Spalding's law (their eqs. 16–17, κ 0.41, B 5.5) at that node's velocity and distance, ρ
//! its density. That velocity is the one the collision uses (with the half body force).
//!
//! **Index mapping.** Their Table A-1 numbers D3Q19 differently from [`crate::lattice`]; their
//! populations are mapped by velocity vector (the wall at `y = 0`, the fluid above): 7 (1,1,0) →
//! 7, 8 (−1,−1,0) → 8, 13 (1,−1,0) → 9, 14 (−1,1,0) → 10, 9 (1,0,1) → 11, 10 (−1,0,−1) → 12,
//! 15 (1,0,−1) → 13, 16 (−1,0,1) → 14, 11 (0,1,1) → 15, 12 (0,−1,−1) → 16, 17 (0,1,−1) → 17,
//! 18 (0,−1,1) → 18, 0–6 the same. So eq. 14a–b reads, in our numbering, `f*_7 = f_9 + τ_{w,x}/2`,
//! `f*_10 = f_8 − τ_{w,x}/2`, `f*_15 = f_18 + τ_{w,z}/2`, `f*_17 = f_16 − τ_{w,z}/2` (lattice
//! units, `Δt = Δy = 1`). The code works from the vectors for any of the six faces.
//!
//! **Grid.** The grid is cell-centred, the box faces half a cell outside the outermost centres.
//! At a box face with this wall the outermost cell layer is the boundary nodes: the wall plane
//! passes through their centres, half a cell inside the box face, and the first interior node is
//! one cell further, at `Δy` from the wall. A channel's wall-to-wall distance is therefore the
//! box height less one cell: 2δ on `2N + 1` cells across with `N` cells per δ.
//!
//! **Boundary nodes are not fluid.** They run eq. 14, not the collision, so they have no eddy
//! viscosity, no hybrid blend and no σ, take no part in the finite-difference gradients of their
//! neighbours (which are one-sided there, as at a box face), and are left out of the fluid's
//! cells, mass, mean velocity and fields (reported like solid cells). Their populations that
//! stream out through the box face are dropped. Their populations that would stream in from
//! outside the box are not needed: eq. 14 writes every population of the node from those
//! arriving from the fluid and from the neighbouring boundary nodes. Before eq. 14 each of them
//! is set to the specular image of the one arriving from the fluid (the free-slip ghost); it
//! reaches only the populations that leave the box, and with it the node's 19 populations sum to
//! the same before and after eq. 14, the mass conservation the paper states. The populations
//! parallel to the wall only ever bounce between boundary nodes: they never meet the fluid.
//!
//! **Wall force.** Each step the wall takes the momentum the boundary nodes take from the fluid:
//! `Σ c_q f_q` over the populations arriving from the fluid less `Σ c_q f*_q` over those eq. 14
//! sends back into it. Parallel to the wall that is the stress, `τ_w` per node and step (wall
//! area `Δx²`), to round-off, whatever the normal flow; along the normal it is the bounce-back's
//! `2 Σ f_q` of the populations arriving from the fluid (their pressure and normal momentum flux).
//!
//! **Obstacles, edges and corners** (FieldCraft's extension, not the paper's). A fluid cell next to
//! a wall along one of the six axes (a solid cell, or outside the box through a wall face) is a
//! boundary node, the wall through its centre: at a box face the outermost layer, as above; at an
//! obstacle, the fluid layer next to it. Eq. 14 is applied link pair by link pair ([`roles`],
//! [`on_links`]): along the normal, and on each tangential pair `n ± e_b` whose two cells and the
//! normal neighbour are fluid, it is eq. 14 (a pair carries `τ_{w,b}` exactly and keeps mass, as on
//! a plane wall); every other link to the fluid (an edge, a corner, the sides of a plate's leading
//! edge, a pair cut by a corner) is halfway bounce-back, its momentum exchange counted as the
//! node's edge impulse; a node at a concave corner (two wall directions) has no normal and only
//! bounces. A stress a node can't carry is set to zero and the law's full request kept beside it
//! ([`WallNode::wanted`]), so the wall takes exactly the stress it applies. A plane node runs
//! [`on_node`] unchanged.
//!
//! **Junctions.** Where a wall meets an inlet, outlet or slip face, the cell in that face's layer
//! keeps the face's rule and is no node (one rule per cell, as at the edge of two open faces): its
//! links to the wall stay halfway bounce-back, and the node beside it treats it as fluid. Walls
//! that meet at an edge or corner of the box give corner nodes, which only bounce.
//!
//! **Where it runs.** On walls at rest: box faces and obstacles. Moving walls and obstacle faces,
//! and heat, are refused ("not supported yet"), as is a geometry that leaves no fluid cell. The
//! GPU backend runs the plane box-face scheme (`crates/lbm-gpu/src/lbm.wgsl`, `node_bounce`) and
//! refuses the rest.
//!
//! No code of any lattice Boltzmann package was read; this is written from the paper.
